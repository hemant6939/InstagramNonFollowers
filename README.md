# InstagramNonFollowers
A web app that identifies Instagram users who donâ€™t follow you back by comparing your followers and following lists from HTML files. Built using Flask and BeautifulSoup, this tool allows users to upload HTML files, find non-followers, and download the result. Includes a vibrant Instagram-like UI.

## Features

- Compare two lists: one with users you follow and one with users who follow you.
- Identify users who follow you but don't follow you back.
- Generate an easy-to-read report with the non-followers.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/InstagramNonFollowers.git
